    "desc": "Black N White is a remake of Black and White by GDColon.The level presents a mostly-greyscale color scheme, with its visuals based on fast color switches, bright effects and flashing lights. The gameplay is very learny, but not memory. Each part is very diverse, some with unusual tricks that may get the player off-guard. Practice is advised. Huge epilepsy warning though",
